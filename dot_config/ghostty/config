# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /home/jrestrepo/.config/ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.

# font-size = 12
font-family = Iosevka Term Nerd Font
font-size = 12

# Font features
font-feature = "+calt"     # keep contextual ligatures
font-feature = "+ss08"     # (optional) Pragmata Pro style variant
font-feature = "+cv83=1"   # (optional) better lowercase 'l'
font-feature = "+cv86=1"   # (optional) better zero with dot

# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put

# background = #123abc

# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.

# # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
# # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
# # Just for example:
# resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms
